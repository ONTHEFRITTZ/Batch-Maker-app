# Batch Maker - Master TODO List
*Last Updated: January 26, 2026*

-On the app the long press menu sits behind the active batches lower on the list

-The Overview Page is horrendously dull and needs to be made more useful. I dont know how at the moment.


-The app and website need a cosmetic overhaul including subtle quality of life improvements.

-put a settings button beside the account button. In here we want the night/day modes, a section to toggle each element on each tab of the dashboard visibility on or off (customize the portal to allow ease of use. Maybe they dont use a lot of the features. I want everything toggled on by default.

-ability to print barcodes from the web portal that correspond to active batches. Someone can scan that barcode with the app to see the details of that workflow (assigned or not, what step it is on, remaining time on the timer etc.) and either determine if it is the batch they are looking for or claim it and continue working on it.

-find a way to integrate into any major POS system to get sales data. This will help track costing, revenue and other analytics data that may be helpful. We need the ability to export these different types of data in whatever format is most appropriate (xsls or csv etc)

-either switch to RevenueCat again or stick with stripe ($25/month for unlimited users. Maybe $5 per month for a solo user with dashboard access (no sync)?

-new user interactive tutorial/walkthrough.

-Allow users to download language packs that translate the app into the desired language. (allows a boss or premium account holder to hire new immigrants or foreigners and have those individuals be able to work together with others in their own native language for efficiency) This could DRASTICALLY expedite new employee/user/contractor integration.

-Voice control/hands free mode. (need a “Hey google” style command that also doesnt trigger another users device (ie if im standing next to another user, my initiate hands free mode command should not activate it for them as well. Maybe use the device user name in the command? “Hey Eli’s Phone” if the user has named his device Eli in the app). This will need careful attention to do right.

Do we build a desktop app?

- Reports hidden from free users when synced (privacy)
- Always test on real devices, not just simulators
- Prioritize bakery-specific features over generic PM tools

### Nice-to-Have vs Must-Have
- Must-Have: Core workflow execution, timers, checklists
- Nice-to-Have: AI features, integrations, marketplace

### Questions to Answer
- Should we allow free users to create templates and sell them?
- What's the right enterprise pricing tier?
- Should we build a desktop app (Electron)?
- Do we need video chat for remote training?
